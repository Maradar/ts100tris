=========

This branch uses AMX (Counter Strike) scripting and Pawn virtual machine written in pure assembly.

Hold button B to run prebuilt AUTOEXEC.AMX uploaded to the USB drive (see the scripts directory).

I had to comment out settings menu despite the engine is quite small (about 5 kb of Thumb-2 code).

There should be enough space on the USB drive to replace the entire menu with scripting.
